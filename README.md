### About DRLND

The DRLND program teaches cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning algorithmsâ€”from Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). We will apply these concepts to train agents to walk, drive, or perform other complex tasks, and build a robust portfolio of deep reinforcement learning projects.
